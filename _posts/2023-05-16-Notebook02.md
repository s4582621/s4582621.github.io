# Notebook 02 - Saving a basic model

1. TOC
{:toc}

## What did I do?
This notebook defines how to create and save a trained model. The images are downloaded and labelled based on their specific type (cats or dogs). The resnet model is then 
trained using the labelled images. Using the Leariner module the information required to run the model can be exported and used elsewhere (within an app for example).

## What did I learn?
- Trained models can be saved and exported using in built functionality within kaggle.
- This process is actually fairly simple
