# Notebook05 - Linear Model and a Neural network from scratch

1. TOC

## What did I do?
This notebook described how to design a neural network from scratch (not using pre-built architecture). Data was taken from a table (CSV file) and cleaned. Dummy variable 
were created so that predictors and target variables could be ascertained. A linear model was then set up for the created matrix of variables and a single epoch of gradient 
descent instigated. The model was trained and the accuracy measured. Using signmoid the probabilities were fixed between 0 and 1. Coefficients were established for the neural 
network and by added more matrix multiplications a deep learining network was finally created.

## What did I learn?
- Pre-built architectures greatly simplify the design of deep learing networks.
- Complex networks all follow the same basic steps mentioned for construction.
