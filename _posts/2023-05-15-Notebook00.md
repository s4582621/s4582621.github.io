# Notebook 00 - Is it a bird?

## What did I do?

The first notebook described the process to create a deep learning model from unique data. This was done through kaggles duck duck go search library extension in python.
This allowed for bird and forest photos to be uniquely searched for on the web so that they could be used for algorithim training. 200 images for each category (birds & forest)
where obtained and resized, with any non working image links removed. A Resnet model with 18 layers was downloaded from pytorch data. This model was pretrained (optimised)
with the imagenet phot database and trained with 20% of the specified bird and forest images downloaded. In fastai this process was done through a datablock and the finetune method.
The model was tested with a bird picture and found to provide 100% accuracy for classification.

## What did I learn?

- Fastai provides a platform for pretty easy implementation of deep learning structures. 
- Moreover, using the duck duck go extension to search for images randomly was something 
which I had previously considered to be not as easily implementable as what was shown.
