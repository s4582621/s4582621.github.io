# Notebook 07 - How random forests work (decision trees)

1. TOC
{:toc}

## What did I do?
This notebook showed how to use desicion trees to better benchmark certain types of data (tabulated). After pre-processing the tabulated data a binary split was created.
The decision tree was built up from this binary split. The performance of the binary split as a benchmark was then measured in a number of ways to be compared to the 
more complex random forest which was established based on a more complex version of the decision tree used earlier. Ultimately the random forest didn't improve on the 
decision tree.

## What did I learn?
- Decision trees provide better benchmarks for tabulated data
- More complex doesn't always equate to better
