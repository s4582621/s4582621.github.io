## What did I do?
In this Notebook Jerermy describes the process behind a submission of a basic model for a kaggle competition. Using fastkaggle, the data required is downloaded. After looking 
at the images they are pre-processed through re-sizing. An initial model is chosen and trained with the image dataset (dataloader created). A CSV file is created from the 
train and prediction results and uploaded to kaggle.

## What did I learn?
- A basic model can be created and uploaded to kaggle with only a few simple steps.
- Using an initial model, rapid iterations can provide much better results.
