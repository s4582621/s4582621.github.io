# Notebook 04 - How does a neural network really work?

## What did I do?
This notebook describes how neural networks can approximate any given computable function. With these computable functions coming in almost any form. It does this through Matrix
multiplication and negative number manipulation. This was shown through creating a function (quadratic) and fitting it with a basic gradient descent. Changes in fitting accuracy
were shown with data (tensors) which included noise. It was then shown how this approach for fitting through a gradient descent can be automated.

## What did I learn?
- Each layer in a neural network contains a function which acts to 'fit' data
- Inputs are multiplied by paramters, these values are grouped, and negative values are zeroed.
