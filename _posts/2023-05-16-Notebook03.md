# Notebook 03 - What image models are best

1. TOC
{:toc}

## What did I do?
This notebook described several ways to view model metrics and ascertain effectiveness. This was mainly achieved through pytorch image models (timm). Using the pandas python
library csv files can be read in and interpolated (example imagnet classification results). One metric model is the inference performance. A chart can be stablished using 
the inference performance to provide a visual guide. A similar process can be used to achieve a visula model for training performance.

## What did I learn?
- Their are multiple ways to ascertain performace
- timm is an effective library to do so for deep learning using pytorch
