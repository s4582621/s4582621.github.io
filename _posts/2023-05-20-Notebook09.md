## What did I do?
In this Notebook Jerermy attempts to optimize the model which was created in the previous notebook for the kaggle competition. The image pixels where reduced through additional
re-sizing to optimize performance. An additional model (ConvNext) was used this time as the model framework. Padding was used to further optimise the images in pre-processing.
TTA - a variation of simple data augmentation - was then implemented. With improved results, the steps taken where redone on scaled-back images. This ultimately produced
a better performing model than the previous notebook.

## What did I learn?
- There are many ways to pre-process datasets to achieve better model performance.
