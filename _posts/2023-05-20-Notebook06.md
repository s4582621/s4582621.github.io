# Notebook 06 - Why a framework should be used

1. TOC
{:toc}

## What did I do?
This notebook provides how to generate and train a model using a framwork (not from scratch). Many of the steps are similar to the previous notebook however with much
less actual coding work. The data is prepped, split into training and validation sets. The training set is fed into th emodel through fastai Learner. This learner can be 
exported and submitted to kaggle. Additional models can easily be trained from random starting points now. Averaging these models is called ensembelling and makes 
model results even more accurate.

## What did I learn?
- Using framworks (pre-built architectures) are much easier, however many attributes of the deep learining process are hidden
- Ensembelling is just one way to optimise the performance of a neural network.
